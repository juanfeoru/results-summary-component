## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM naming convention

### What I learned

I reinforced my knowledge of **mobile-first responsive design** and how to use **flexbox** to create adaptive layouts. I also practiced writing **clean and maintainable CSS** using BEM and custom properties.

```css
.result-summary__item {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  border-radius: 0.6rem;
  padding: 0.8rem 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue improving my accessibility practices (like semantic headings and alt text) and focus more on writing DRY CSS by reusing styles instead of repeating similar rules.
